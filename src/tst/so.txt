I learned that when you import a module, that module it runs only once - the first time. But I have this situation where it seems it is running twice. Or is it?

``` lang-typescript
//L.ts

Class L {
  public names:string[];
  constructor(){
    this.names = [];
  }
  public log(){
    for(const n of this.name)
      console.log(n);
  }
}
export default new L();

```
``` lang-typescript
//B.ts

import L from './L';
L.names['']
```
``` lang-typescript
//A.ts

import L from './L';
import '.B';
```
``` lang-typescript
//index.ts

import './A';
```
